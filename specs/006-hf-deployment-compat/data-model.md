# Data Model: Hugging Face Deployment Compatibility

**Feature**: Hugging Face Deployment Compatibility
**Date**: 2026-01-15
**Status**: Complete

## Overview

This feature involves deployment configuration changes rather than new data models. The existing data models from the chatbot application remain unchanged.

## Configuration Entities

### Server Configuration
- **Host**: String value representing the network interface to bind to (e.g., "0.0.0.0")
- **Port**: Integer value representing the network port to listen on
- **Environment Variables**: Key-value pairs for runtime configuration

### Health Check Response
- **Status**: String indicating the health status of the application ("healthy")
- **Timestamp**: ISO 8601 formatted string indicating when the check was performed
- **Additional Metadata**: Optional fields for extended health information

## Relationships

The configuration entities interact as follows:
- Server Configuration determines the host and port binding
- Health Check Response is generated by the health endpoint
- Environment Variables influence Server Configuration at runtime

## Constraints

- Port must be a valid network port number (1-65535)
- Host must be a valid IP address or hostname
- Health check response must be in JSON format
- All existing data models remain unchanged
